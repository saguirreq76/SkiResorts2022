A dashboard in Power BI that focuses on a Ski Resorts dataset can provide a comprehensive overview of key points such as price, location, difficulty of slopes, types of lifts, and seasonal availability of resorts. This dashboard can help skiers and resort managers make informed decisions about where to go skiing, when to go, and what to expect.
